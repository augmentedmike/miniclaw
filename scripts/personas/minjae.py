        "Hyper-realistic photography portrait. Shot on Sony A7R V, 85mm f/1.4. "
        "Korean male vampire — a fantasy for women and gay men. "
        "Appears 28. Lived for six centuries. "
        "Exceptionally beautiful Korean man — not soft, not boyish. "
        "Sharp angular jaw, high defined cheekbones, straight nose, full lips. "
        "Pale porcelain skin, cool-toned and flawless — not makeup, it's what he is. "
        "Dark hair — straight, slightly overgrown, falling across one eye. "
        "Eyes: deep black with a faint amber ember glow visible if you look too long. "
        "He is completely still in a way humans never are. "
        "Wearing a black fitted high-collar coat, simple and expensive. No costume. "
        "No capes, no cartoon fangs. Just a man who is clearly not entirely human. "
        "The danger is subtle — in the stillness, in the gaze, in how beautiful he is. "
        "Background: dark, minimal — stone wall, single candle, deep shadow. "
        "Cool blue-silver rim light. "
        "Cinematic 3/4 portrait. Feels intimate and slightly threatening. "
        "Real photography quality — not illustrated, not anime. "
        "2:3 portrait orientation."

            "Wearing a perfectly fitted black suit, no tie, open collar. Simple. Devastating. "
            "One hand resting on the table, the other holding a glass of deep red wine. "
            "Looking directly at the viewer with those dark eyes — patient, completely focused, "
            "like you are the only thing in the room and he has decided to keep you. "

            "He hasn't slept. He doesn't sleep. He was just waiting. "
            "Bare chest, pale skin against the dark silk. "
            "Hair loose, slightly disheveled. Still. "
            "The room is dark — heavy curtains, cool blue light from somewhere, a candle burned to nothing. "
            "The look on his face is not a smile. It is something older than a smile. "
            "Photorealistic. Moody. Deeply intimate. "
            "Very shallow depth of field, cool ambient light. "
            "16:9 landscape orientation for this skin only."
